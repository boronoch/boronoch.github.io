<b>Topic:</b> Everyone bring an opinion or an article or something interesting about COVID-19. Could be stories of hardship or of communities banding together. Could be policy decisions and debates. Could be something about our personal response to it: where do we draw the line on quarantining? How can we help those impacted directly or indirectly (sick or laid off)? What businesses need our support?
</p>
<p>
<b>Invitation:</b> We've talked in the past about inviting significant others to a BoF night. I think this could be the perfect time to do that. We're all going to be home anyway, it's a topic that affects everyone, and it's a very gender-neutral topic! Wives, fiances, girlfriends, roommates, etc could all be invited.

<p>
My question for the group is, do we want to take a full week for this topic right now?
</p>
<b>Reasons not to do this:</b> We talked about it most of last week anyway. And there may not be much we can do about it. It's also not really a Scripture/Catechism/Catholic topic. Or if we do cover it, should we wait a week or two?
</p>
<p>
<b>Reasons to do this:</b> We have always been more than just a "Bible Study" group, and Current Events are well within our wheelhouse. This virus marks a moment in time that will not be soon forgotten, and it's good for us to continue process it as a group. We talked about it a lot already last week, but we certainly didn't exhuast it. Hitting it again with some prior research and with others invited could be very fruitful.
